### Methods of Separation
- Filtration
	- Separates an insoluble solid from a mixture
	- The solvent can pass through the filter paper but the solid cannot
	- Scientific Diagram:

- Evaporation
	- Separates a solute from a solution
	- Mixture is heated in evaporating basin
		- Solvent is evaporated leaving solid solute
	- High yield of solute
	- Solvent is lost to evaporation
		- Evaporation is used when you don't need solvent

- Crystallisation
	- Separates a solute from a solution
	- Cool, supersaturated solution is heated in evaporating basin
	- Pure crystals form in solvent
	- There is a large loss of solute
		- Why do we use crystallisation over evaporation sometimes?
			- Some compounds are not thermally stable and will react if you use evaporation
			- Crystallisation gives pure solid crystals without impurities like dust

- Chromatography
	- Many varying types

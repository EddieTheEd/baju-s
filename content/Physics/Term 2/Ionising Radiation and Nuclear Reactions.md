### Isotopes and Radioisotopes
- Isotopes are variations of an element with different numbers of neutrons
	- They have the same number of protons and the same chemical properties
	- However, due to their mass numbers being different, they have different physical properties
- Some isotopes nuclei are unstable leading to them undergoing some form of decay in order to become more stable
	- These unstable atoms are known as <span style="color:yellow;">radioisotopes</span> and are radioactive
		- e.g. carbon-14 is a naturally occurring isotope of carbon that is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay to form nitrogen-14

### Radioactive Decay
- When a <span style="color:yellow;">radioisotope</span> undergoes radioactive decay, it will emit a high-energy particle or wave (radiation), there are several types of particles/waves emitted during radioactive decay:
	- <span style="color:OrangeRed;">Alpha</span> Particles - $\alpha$
		- ${4\atop2}\alpha$ → an alpha particle is a helium nucleus (2 protons, 2 neutrons)
		- Parent atom loses two protons and two neutrons during alpha decay
			- Atomic number decreases by 2, mass number decreases by 4
		- Alpha particles have very **low** penetrating power
			- Can be stopped by paper (therefore it can't penetrate the body)
		- Highly ionising
			- Can be very dangerous if alpha particles are emitted within the body
				- Interesting case where a spy was assassinated by poisoning them with a sample of a radioisotope in their drink that underwent alpha decay in his stomach in early 2000s
		- Fast as 10% of the speed of light
	- <span style="color:aqua;">Beta</span> Particles - $\beta$
		- ${0\atop-1}\beta$ → a beta particle is an electron 
		- Parent atom turns a neutron into a proton and electron, releasing the electron
			- Atomic number increases by 1, mass number does not change
		- Beta particles have **medium** penetrating power
			- Can be stopped by metal 
		- Weakly ionising
		- Fast as 90% of the speed of light
	- <span style="color:aqua;">Beta+</span> Particles - $\beta^+$ 
		- ${0\atop+1}\beta$ → a positively charged beta particle is a <span style="color:gold;">positron</span>
			- Has the same properties as electrons, but is positively charged
			- Positrons are a form of **antimatter**
		- Parent atom turns a proton turns into a neutron, positron and a neutrino $(v)$ and the positron and neutrino are emitted
			- Atomic number decreases by 1, mass number does not change
	- <span style="color:limegreen;">Gamma</span> Waves - $\gamma$
		- ${0\atop0}\gamma$ → gamma radiation is an electromagnetic wave with a very high frequency and small wavelength
		- Parent atom transitions from an excited state to a base state
			- Atom is unchanged
		- Gamma waves have **very high** penetrating power
			- Can be stopped by thick lead, penetrates everything else
		- Very weakly ionising
		- Fast as light
- Nuclear equations must always show mass number, atomic number and chemical symbol for all components

### Fission and Fusion
- <span style="color:orange;">Fission</span> is the process in which an atom is split by a neutron into smaller atoms
	- Model Equation: ${x \atop y}A_p + {0\atop1}n → {x_1 \atop y_1}A_1 + {x_2 \atop y_2}A_2 + 2{0\atop1}n + {0\atop0}\gamma$
		- $x_1 + x_2 = x,\ \ y_1 + y_2 = y$
	- A fission reaction can emit 2 or 3 neutrons
	- There can be more than two products however the combined mass and atomic number will still equal the parent atom's mass and atomic number
- <span style="color:pink;">Fusion</span> is the process in which two or more atoms are combined into a larger atom
	- Model Equation: ${x_1 \atop y_1}A_1 + {x_2 \atop y_2}A_2 → {x \atop y}A_r$
		- $x_1 + x_2 = x,\ \ y_1 + y_2 = y$
	- The resultant atom will have the combine mass and atomic number of all the components

### Mass Defect
- The mass defect is the difference between the expected total mass of a nucleus (mass of nucleons) and the actual total mass recorded (mass of nucleus)
	- *Mass Defect = Mass of Nucleons - Mass of Nucleus*
- The reason that the total mass is less than the expected mass is due to some mass becoming binding energy which helps hold the nucleus together
	- Energy and mass are interchangeable through the equation $E = mc^2$ 
- The greater the binding energy, the more stable the nucleus

### Half-Life
- Radioisotopes decay sporadically and thus can be difficult to measure the decay rate by normal means
- Instead, radioactive decay is measured in half-lives
	- A <span style="color:lightgreen;">half-life</span> is the amount of time it takes for half of the radionuclides in a sample of a given radioisotope to decay
- Half-life is graphed using an exponential graph measuring the count rate (radiation) over time
  ![[HalfLifeGraph]]
- Possible ways to measure half-life (with problems):
	1. Number of nuclides
	   - However the decayed nuclides are now nuclides of a different isotope
	2. Mass
	   - However actual mass of entire sample will not change significantly since little actual mass is lost, most is converted into mass of other isotopes
	3. Activity measured - disintegrations per second (dps) or becquerel (Bq)
	   - The Geiger counter can't discriminate between 2 or more decays occurring simultaneously
	   - The Geiger counter will count decay from radioactive daughter nuclide and it 
- Finding the number of radionuclides present:
	- N = Number of radionuclides remaining at present time
		- N = N$_0 * \frac{1}{2}^n$ \[on data sheet]
		- N$_0$ = Original # of radionuclides (at t$_0$)
		- n = Number of half-lives which have elapsed
			- n = $\frac{t}{t_\frac{1}{2}}$ \[not on data sheet]
				- Where $t$ = elapsed time and $t\frac{1}{2}$ = half life of isotope

### Strong Nuclear Force
- <span style="color:lightgreen;">Strong nuclear force</span> is the force between protons and neutrons that hold the nucleus together
- Protons are like-charged particles, meaning they repel each other through electrostatic forces
	- However, strong nuclear force is much stronger, overpowering the electrostatic forces and holding the nucleus together
- Neutrons are attracted to neutrons and protons
	- There needs to be a certain number of neutrons to hold the nucleus together
		- The number of neutrons and protons need to balance out each other, too many or few neutrons can lead to the nucleus falling apart and undergoing radioactive decay
		- For larger nuclei, there needs to be more neutrons than protons to overcome the strong electrostatic force of attraction

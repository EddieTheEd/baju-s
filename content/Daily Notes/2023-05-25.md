- Rohan's 18th Birthday
	- Didn't get much time to study at their house
- Had two exams today - Physics and Economics
	- I think Physics went ok, it wasn't super time pressured but I'm way too slow
		- I need to understand Newton's laws better
		- My fundamental knowledge is not bad but I need the time to apply it
	- Economics went well
		- I think I did very well, hopefully
		- Unluckily I got the most difficult topic for the extended response but it went ok

- English exam went well today
	- I think I did best in the composing
		- I used a pre-made persuasive response and adapted it in the exam
			- This was very effective
			- It wasn't as good as my home response but it was pretty good
	- Responding was ok
		- Needed to create an essay that I could adapt like I did for composing in future
	- I used a gel pen which I'm not supposed to use
		- Need to get other pens for my exam bag
	- My timing was also very good in the exam

- Took a bit of a breather after coming home

- Feeling pretty solid
	- Still dragged into SAO way too much tho

- Doing well in the tipping
	- Went up three places, 8/9 tips won

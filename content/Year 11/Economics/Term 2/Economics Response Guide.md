### Double Curve Shift
- Use correct diagram
	- Illustrate both curve shifts on diagram and refer to the diagram when explaining the curve shifts
		- e.g. demand falls from D$_0$ to D$_1$ as seen on the diagram
		- Use arrows on your diagram and make sure to label every curve!
- Explain the shift for demand/supply
	- Refer to diagram
- Explain the outcomes for price and quantity
	- Price and quantity can't always be determined, you must state this
	- e.g. when demand and supply both increase, we cannot determine the effect on price

### Taxes and Subsidies
- Define tax or subsidy (depending on the question)
	- e.g. 'Subsidies are payments from the government to firms'
- Discuss the impact of a tax or subsidy on **price, quantity and surpluses (CS, PS, DWL)**
	- Example for Subsidies:
		- Decrease in price for consumers and increased benefit to producers from the revenue determined by price and the money obtained from the subsidy
			- Results in an increase in both consumer surplus and producer surplus
		- The benefit from the additional CS and PS is less than the cost to governments from providing the subsidy
			- This results in a deadweight loss due to the inefficient allocation of resources
- Diagram Example (Subsidy):

### Market Failure
- Remember to always use a diagram and refer to points on the diagram throughout your response
- Using assessment 3 as an example (negative production externalities affecting the MSC curve)
	- Define market failure
		- e.g. 'Market failure is when resources are allocated inefficiently in a market leading to resources being lost to society'
	- Define and **Explain** MPC, MPB, MEC, MSC
		- MSC = MPC + MEC
		- Define negative production externality
			- Give examples of negative production externalities **briefly**
				- You get marks for explaining using theory, not by piling on evidence
		- At market output MSC is greater than MPC reflecting MEC
	- Explain external cost is not captured in the market
		- MPC $\neq$ MSC
		- The price is lower than it should be due to the true cost not being reflected in the market
	- Overproduction leads to overallocation of resources â†’ Inefficiency
	- Inefficiency results in deadweight loss (DWL) (refer to diagram)
		- Explain DWL briefly

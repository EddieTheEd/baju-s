### The Circular Flow of Income
- The Circular Flow of Income is a [macroeconomic](Macroeconomics.md) model that describes the flow of income and expenditure between different sectors in the economy
  
  ![[CircularFlowModel.png|600]]
	- Components affecting the CFI:
	  - Savings (S)
	  - Investments (I)
	  - Government Expenditure (G) and Taxation (T)
	  - Export Revenue (X) and Import Expenditure (M)
	- Injections vs Withdrawals
		- Injections are inflows of money into the circular flow of income
			- I + G + X
		- Withdrawals are outflows of money out of the circular flow of income
			- S + T + M
		- An economy is in equilibrium when injections = withdrawals (STM = IGX)
	- The CFI highlights an important principle:
		- <span style="color:lime;">Income</span> flow from firms to households = the <span style="color:orange;">expenditure</span> flow from households to firms

### Aggregate Expenditure (AE)
- Measuring Economic Activity - (known as <span style="color:gold;">National Income Accounting</span> Methods)
	- <span style="color:lime;">National Income</span> measures the **monetary value** of the flow of output of goods and services produced in an economy over a period of time
		- Purpose of <span style="color:gold;">National Income Accounting</span> is to provide data to **monitor the performance** of the overall economy
	- <span style="color:lime;">National Income</span> can be measured in 3 ways:
		- Expenditure Approach
			- Adds up all spending to buy final goods and services produced within a given time period
			- National Expenditure = C + I + G + (X-M)
				- C = Consumer Spending
		- Income Approach
			- Adds up all income earned by the factors of production that produce all goods and services within a given time period
			- National Income = W + R + I + P
				- Wages, rent, interest, profit
		- Output Approach
			- Calculates the value of all final goods and services produced in a country over a time period
		- National Expenditure = National Income = National Output

### Determinants of Growth
- Actual Growth vs Potential Growth
	- Actual Growth
		- GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
		- The actual output of the economy
	- Potential Growth
		- Change in quantity and/or quality of factors of production
		- The capacity of the economy
- <span style="color:aqua;">Investment</span> and Economic Growth
	- Allocating scarce funds to capital goods is known as real <span style="color:aqua;">investment</span>
	- To achieve potential growth, the economy must use more of its resources to produce capital rather than consumer goods
		- Standards of living are reduced in the short run as resources are diverted away from private consumption
		- However, the increased investment in capital goods enables more output of consumer goods to be produced in the long run
			- Standards of living will increase in the future more than they would have if the economy had not made a short-term sacrifice
			- Economies face a choice between short-term vs long-term benefit
- <span style="color:aqua;">Investment</span> in New Technology
	- Potential growth increases because new technology is inevitably more efficient than old technology
		- Production can increase because the new technology is more efficient
			- Output does not necessarily increase
	- Actual growth increases due to <span style="color:aqua;">investment</span>
		- There is a transaction to buy the new technology which becomes a part of the GDP
- Failure to <span style="color:aqua;">Invest</span>
	- Depreciation will reduce an economy's capacity
		- Machines will worsen and break over time
		- New workers need to be educated
	- Investments in human and real capital need to <u>compensate for depreciation</u>
		- If investment does not happens, the PPF will slowly shift inward
	- Human capital refers to work force
	- Real capital refers to machines/technology
- Erosion of Infrastructure (and Human Capital)
	- Military conflict or national disasters can destroy factories, people, infrastructure, etc.
- Asymmetric Growth
	- A economy can grow from increased productivity in one sector of the economy
		- This is asymmetric growth
	- If an improvement in technology applied to the motor vehicle industry, but not to the food industry, it would be illustrated by a shift of the PPF from one axis only

### Benefits and Costs of Economic Growth
- Economic growth incurs benefits and costs for people's standard of living
	- Even though growth implies increasing levels of real income, therefore ability to satisfy more wants, there are costs brough with economic growth

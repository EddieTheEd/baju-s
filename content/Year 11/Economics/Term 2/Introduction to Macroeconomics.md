### The Circular Flow of Income
- The Circular Flow of Income is a [macroeconomic](Macroeconomics.md) model that describes the flow of income and expenditure between different sectors in the economy
  
  ![[CircularFlowModel.png|600]]
	- Components affecting the CFI:
	  - Savings (S)
	  - Investments (I)
	  - Government Expenditure (G) and Taxation (T)
	  - Export Revenue (X) and Import Expenditure (M)
	- Injections vs Withdrawals
		- Injections are inflows of money into the circular flow of income
			- I + G + X
		- Withdrawals are outflows of money out of the circular flow of income
			- S + T + M
		- An economy is in equilibrium when injections = withdrawals (STM = IGX)
	- The CFI highlights an important principle:
		- <span style="color:lime;">Income</span> flow from firms to households = the <span style="color:orange;">expenditure</span> flow from households to firms

### Measures of Economic Activity
- Measuring Economic Activity is also known as <span style="color:gold;">National Income Accounting</span> Methods
- <span style="color:lime;">National Income (GDP)</span> is a measure of the **monetary value** of the flow of output of goods and services produced in an economy over a period of time
	- Purpose of <span style="color:gold;">National Income Accounting</span> is to provide data to **monitor the performance** of the overall economy
	- <span style="color:lime;">National Income</span> is the same as [[Economic Growth#Determinants of Growth|actual growth]]
- <span style="color:lime;">National Income</span> can be measured in 3 ways:
	- Expenditure Approach
		- Adds up all spending to buy final goods and services produced within a given time period
		- National Expenditure = C + I + G + (X-M)
			- C = Consumer Spending/Consumption Expenditure
	- Income Approach
		- Adds up all income earned by the factors of production that produce all goods and services within a given time period
		- National Income = W + R + I + P
			- Wages, rent, interest, profit
	- Output Approach
		- Calculates the value of all final goods and services produced in a country over a time period
	- National Expenditure = National Income = National Output

### Aggregate Expenditure
- Aggregate Expenditure (AE) is the total **planned** expenditure on final goods and services at a given price level by economic agents
	- The aggregate expenditure is the total expenditure in the economy

#### Components of Aggregate Expenditure
- Aggregate Expenditure is made of consumption expenditure (C), investment expenditure (I), government expenditure (G) and net expenditure on exports (X $-$ M)
	- C + I + G + (X $-$ M)
		- Households + Firms + Government + Foreign
- ##### Consumption Expenditure (C)
	- Consumption expenditure is the purchase of <u>domestic</u> goods and services
		- It is the part of national income spend on consumer goods
	- Factors Affecting Consumption Expenditure:
		- Income (Disposable) $Y_d$
		- Level of Interest Rates
		- Accessibility of Credit
		- Government Policy
		- Price Expectations
		- Savings
- ##### Investment Expenditure (I)
	- Investments are expenditure on <u>capital goods</u>, stocks of raw materials and <span style="color:lightgreen;">intermediate goods</span>
		- An <span style="color:lightgreen;">intermediate good</span> is a product used to produce a final good or finished product
	- Factors Affecting Investment Expenditure:
		- Interest Rates
		- Business Expectations
		- Government Policy
		- Technological Change
		- Infrastructure
- ##### Government Expenditure (G)
	- Government expenditure is spending by the government 
		- It is independent of changes in national income in short-term
	- Government expenditure is broken into two sectors:
		- <span style="color:yellow;">G1:</span> Current expenditure which provides for day to day functions of the government
		- <span style="color:lime;">G2:</span> Current expenditure to provide for future needs
			- e.g. schools, roads, power, communications, dams, etc.
- ##### Net Expenditure (X $-$ M)
	- X - Export Revenue
		- Refers to revenue received from the sale of g&s to foreign countries
		- An increase in export revenue will cause an increase in output and income
		- Exports are **influenced** by the national income **of the foreign country** and are <u>independent</u> of the national income <u>of the local economy</u>
	- M - Import Revenue
		- Refers to expenditure incurred from purchasing g&s from foreign countries
		- Imports are a financial leakage from the circular flow of income

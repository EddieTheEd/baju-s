### Methods of Separation (TBF)
- Sieving
	- A porous material is used to separate particles of different sizes
- Filtration
	- Separates an insoluble solid from a mixture
	- The solvent can pass through the filter paper but the solid cannot
	- Scientific Diagram:

- Decanting
	- Separates particulates from a liquid by allowing the solids to settle as the bottom of the mixture and pouring off the particle-free part of the liquid
	- The liquid left in the solids must be removed later
	- This only works when the components are immiscible
- Separation Funnel (See OneNote for diagram until its updated)
	- Used to separate heterogenous mixture
	- Components will settle into different layers
- Distillation
	- Normal Distillation

	- Fractional Distillation
		- Scientific Diagram (TBF)
- Magnetic Susceptibility
- Electrostatic Attraction
- Vaporisation
- Evaporation
	- Separates a solute from a solution
	- Mixture is heated in evaporating basin
		- Solvent is evaporated leaving solid solute
	- High yield of solute
	- Solvent is lost to evaporation
		- Evaporation is used when you don't need solvent

- Crystallisation
	- Separates a solute from a solution
	- Cool, supersaturated solution is heated in evaporating basin
	- Pure crystals form in solvent
	- There is a large loss of solute
		- Why do we use crystallisation over evaporation sometimes?
			- Some compounds are not thermally stable and will react if you use evaporation
			- Crystallisation gives pure solid crystals without impurities like dust

- Chromatography
	- Many varying types

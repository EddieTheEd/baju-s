### What is Solubility?
- <span style="color:lightgreen;">Solubility</span> is the mass of a substance that will dissolve in 100g of water at 25$\degree$C
- <span style="color:lightgreen;">Saturated Solution</span> → No more solute will dissolve at set temperature
- <span style="color:lightgreen;">Unsaturated Solution</span> → Less solute than needed to make a saturated solution
- <span style="color:lightgreen;">Supersaturated solution</span> → Unstable solution that causes crystals of solute to form if disturbed (forms from cooling saturated solution)
- #### Solubility Curves
	- Solubility curves highlight the change in solubility for a substance when the temperature changes
	- Example Solubility Graph: 
	  ![[Solubility Graph.png|300]]
		- Points below the curve represent an unsaturated solution
		- Points on the curve represent a saturated solution
		- This is a solubility graph for different compound in water

### Why do compounds dissolve?
- For bonds to be broken → endothermic → requires energy
- Attractions form between the solvent and solute → exothermic → releases energy
- If energy released > energy required → compound will dissolve
	- Requires attraction between solute and solvent to generate energy
		- Polar dissolves polar as they can form dipole-dipole interaction
		- Non-polar dissolves non-polar due to dispersion forces
			- The dispersion forces must be stronger than the forces of the bonds if the solute
		- **Non-polar cannot dissolve/be dissolved by polar solvents/solutes**

### Ion-Dipole Attraction
- Water and sodium chloride ion-dipole interaction diagram: 
  ![](Excalidraw/Ion-DipoleAttraction|850|)
	- Water is a highly effective solvent for dissolving compounds due to its highly polar nature
	- Solvent molecules form attraction between oppositely charged ions in ionic lattice
		- This is weak, but there are so many molecules that it can break about the network
			- Imagine far more water molecules than seen on the diagram
	- This is a **polar dissolves polar** interaction

### Concentration
- <span style="color:lightblue;">You need to be able to convert between different units for concentration!</span>
- Units for Concentration:
	- Moles per litre → mol L$^{-1}$
		- $\frac{number\ of \ moles}{litre}$
	- Grams per litre → g L$^{-1}$
		- $\frac{grams}{litre}$
	- <span style="color:yellow;">Parts per million</span> → ppm
		- $\frac{mg\ solute}{kg\ solution}$
		-  Milligrams per kilogram
	- <span style="color:orange;">Mass</span> per <span style="color:orange;">100g</span> of water → % m/m
		- $\frac{solute\ mass\ (g)}{solvent\ mass\ (g)}\ ×\ {100\%}$  
			- g/100g
	- <span style="color:#B666D2;">Volume</span> per <span style="color:#B666D2;">100ml</span> of water → % v/v
		- $\frac{solute\ volume\ (ml)}{solvent\ volume\ (ml)}\ ×\ {100\%}$
			- ml/100ml
	- <span style="color:orange;">Mass</span> per <span style="color:#B666D2;">100ml</span> water → % m/v
		- $\frac{solute\ mass\ (g)}{solvent\ volume\ (ml)}\ ×\ {100\%}$
			- g/100ml

### Density
- $\rho$ - density
  ![](DensityTriangle|300|)
	- Density of water → 1 gram mL$^{-1}$
		- 1 mL of water = 1 gram of water
	- mass (g) = density (g mL$^{-1}$) × volume (mL)

### Precipitation Reactions
- In precipitation reactions, there are often ions that are not truly part of the reaction as they do not undergo a chemical reaction
- This is because when compounds are dissolved, ions are delocalised and are free to move in the solution
	- NaCl$_{(aq)}$ + KNO$_3$$_{(aq)}$ actually looks like → Na$^+$$_{(aq)}$ + Cl$^-$$_{(aq)}$ + K$^+$$_{(aq)}$ + NO$_3^-$$_{(aq)}$
		- No reaction is taking place
- A reaction only occurs when two solutions are mixed if a non-aqueous product is formed
- When writing a precipitation (ionic) reaction, omit the ions that are not involved in the reaction
	- e.g. NaCl$_{(aq)}$ + AgNO$_3$$_{(aq)}$ → AgCl$_{(s)}$ + NaNO$_3$$_{(aq)}$ should be written instead as:
	- Ag$^+$$_{(aq)}$ + Cl$^-$$_{(aq)}$ → AgCl$_{(s)}$ where the sodium and nitrate ions are omitted due to them not actually reacting
		- These ions are known as **spectator ions**

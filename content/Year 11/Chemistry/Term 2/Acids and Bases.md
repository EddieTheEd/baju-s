### Definitions for Acids and Bases
- Acids and bases can have different definitions
	- The definitions for these substances have changed overtime
	- E.g. Arrhenius, Bronsted-Lowry, Davy and Lewis are all different definitions
- Arrhenius Acids and Bases
	- An **Arrhenius acid** is any compound that increases the concentration of H$^+$ in aqueous solution
	- An **Arrhenius base** is any compound that increases the concentration of OH$^-$ in aqueous solution
	- Limitations:
		- There are many acids and bases that are not soluble
- Davy Acids (1815)
	- Acids are defined as substances that contain replaceable hydrogen
		- Hydrogen could be replaced partially or completely with metals
		- When acids reacted with metals or bases, they produced salts
	- This is flawed as many compounds contain hydrogen and are not acids
- Bronsted-Lowry Acids and Bases
	- An acid is a proton donor
		- HCl + H$_2$O → H$_3$O$^-$ + Cl$^+$
			- H$_3$O$^-$ - hydronium ion
			- ==Water== can accept or donate protons; it can act as ==an acid or a base==
	- A base is a proton acceptor

### Strong and Weak Acids
- The strength of an acid refers to how much of that acid ionises in an aqueous solution releasing a proton
- Strong acids dissociate fully
	- e.g. HCl, H$_2$SO$_4$, HNO$_3$, etc.
	- HCl → Cl$^-$ + H$_3$O$^+$
- Weak acids dissociate partially
	- e.g. CH$_3$COOH
	- CH$_3$COOH $\rightleftharpoons$ CH$_3$COO$^-$ + H$_3$O$^+$

### Salts
- Salt is a substance that forms when hydrogen in an acid is substituted by metal ion
	- e.g. HCl (acid) → MCl (salt)
	- Salts are formed when Arrhenius acids and bases react

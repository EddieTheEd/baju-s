### Introduction to Acids and Bases
- **Check out Pearson Chapter 17**
- Acids and bases are important substances used in agriculture and industry with many diverse roles
	- Acids and bases interact in many environmental and biological systems undergoing many different chemical reactions

> [!hint] Soluble bases are known as Alkali

### Indicators
- Acids and bases have the ability to change the colour of certain plant extracts which are then used as <u>indicators</u> to reveal the acidity of a substance
	- Litmus is a purple dye obtained from lichen used as an **indicator** for acids and bases

##### The pH Scale
- The acidity of an aqueous substance is measured using a pH value
	- The pH value is dependent on the number of hydrogen ions in the solution
	- Acids have a low pH value, bases have a high pH value
- Universal indicator is widely used to estimate pH of a solution
	- It is an estimate → not super accurate
	- Used in conjunction with a pH colour scale
	- Colour goes from red to violet (acid to base)
- pH is [[Acids and Bases#pH Calculations|calculated]] as: $pH$ $= -log_{10}[H^+]$
	- $H^+$ is the concentration of $H^+$ in mol L$^{-1}$
	- pH is measured on a log scale → a pH of 5 is <u>10 times more acidic</u> than a pH of 6
	- pH values are usually given to two decimal places
- The pH of an acid depends on both its strength and concentration

### pH Calculations
- $pH$ is an [[Acids and Bases#Indicators|indicator]]
- $pH$ $= -log_{10}[H^+]$
	- $pH$ does not have units
- To find the [[Solubility#Concentration|concentration]] of $H^+$ using $pH$ → $10^{-pH} = [H^+]$
	- Measured in mol L$^{-1}$
- Using the above calculations we can find information about $pH$ when dealing with acids, however when dealing with bases ([[Acids and Bases#Bronsted-Lowry Acids and Bases|Bronsted-Lowry bases]]) we are dealing with the concentration of $OH^-$, not $H^+$
	- However we can use the concentration of $OH^-$ to calculate the concentration of $H^+$
		- This is because water can act as a weak Bronsted-Lowry acid or base
			- $H_2O + H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+_{(aq)}\ +\ OH^-_{(aq)} \rightleftharpoons H^+_{(aq)} + OH^-_{(aq)}$
			- Water is a proton donor and acceptor

>[!tip]+ $K_w$ → Ionisation Constant of Water
>The ionisation constant at 25$\degree$C → $K_w = 1\ ×\ 10^{-14}$
>
>$K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1\ ×\ 10^{-14}$
>- Concentration in mol $L^{-1}$
>- $K_w$ is written without units
>
>Using the concentration of $H^+$ or $OH^-$ we can find the concentration of the other ion and thus convert between $pH$, moles and concentration!

- When $pH$ is neutral, the concentration of $H^+$ and $OH^-$ are equal

### Properties of Acids and Bases
- ##### Properties of Acids
	- Turns litmus paper red
	- Usually corrosive
	- Taste sour
	- React with bases
	- Solutions have a pH less than 7
	- Solutions conduct an electric current
- ##### Properties of Bases
	- Turn litmus paper blue
	- Caustic and slippery
	- Taste bitter
	- React with acids
	- Solutions have a pH greater than 7
	- Solutions conduct an electric current

### Definitions for Acids and Bases
- Acids and bases are difficult to define and have several different definitions
	- The definitions for these substances have changed overtime
	- Arrhenius, Bronsted-Lowry, Davy and Lewis are all different definitions

##### Arrhenius Acids and Bases
- An **Arrhenius acid** is any compound that increases the concentration of H$^+$ in aqueous solution
- **Classifying Arrhenius Acids**
	- <span style="color:gold;">Polyprotic acids</span>
		- Some acids can form multiple hydrogen ions per molecule in water, these acids are known as <span style="color:gold;">polyprotic acids</span>
		- The number of hydrogen ions an acid can donate depends on the structure of the molecule
			- This can be difficult to tell as ethanoic acid ($CH_3COOH$) is monoprotic and only forms one hydrogen ion in water
		- <span style="color:aqua;">Diprotic</span> and <span style="color:lime;">triprotic acids</span> are also <span style="color:gold;">polyprotic acids</span>
	- <span style="color:aqua;">Diprotic Acids</span>
		- <span style="color:aqua;">Diprotic acids</span> can donate two protons
		- They can form up to two hydrogen ions per molecule in water
		- Sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$) and carbonic acid ($H_2CO_3$) are <span style="color:aqua;">diprotic acids</span>
		- <span style="color:aqua;">Diprotic acids</span> usually ionise in two stages, however the Arrhenius model represents them as ionising at once
			- e.g. $H_2SO_4 (l) → SO_4^{2-} (aq) + 2H^+ (aq)$
	- <span style="color:lime;">Triprotic Acids</span>
		- <span style="color:lime;">Triprotic acids</span> can donate three protons
		- They can form up to three hydrogen ions per molecule in water
		- Phosphoric acid ($H_3PO_4$) and boric acid ($H_3BO_3$) are <span style="color:lime;">triprotic acids</span>
		- <span style="color:lime;">Triprotic acids</span> usually ionise in multiple stages, however the Arrhenius model represents them as ionising at once
			- e.g. $H_3PO_4 (l) \rightleftharpoons PO_4^{3-} (aq) + 3H^+ (aq)$
				- Note the double arrow because phosphoric acid is a weak acid
- An **Arrhenius base** is any compound that disassociated in water forming  hydroxide ions increasing the concentration of OH$^-$ in aqueous solution
- Limitations:
	- There are many acids and bases that are not soluble

##### Davy Acids (1815)
- Acids are defined as substances that contain replaceable hydrogen
	- Hydrogen could be replaced partially or completely with metals
	- When acids reacted with metals or bases, they produced salts
- This is flawed as many compounds contain hydrogen and are not acids

##### Bronsted-Lowry Acids and Bases
- An acid is a proton donor
	- HCl + H$_2$O → H$_3$O$^-$ + Cl$^+$
		- H$_3$O$^-$ - hydronium ion
		- <u>Water</u> can accept or donate protons; it can act as <u>an acid or a base</u>
- A base is a proton acceptor

### Strong and Weak Acids
- The strength of an acid refers to how much of that acid ionises in an aqueous solution releasing a proton
- Strong acids dissociate fully
	- e.g. HCl, H$_2$SO$_4$, HNO$_3$, etc.
	- HCl → Cl$^-$ + H$_3$O$^+$
- Weak acids dissociate partially
	- e.g. CH$_3$COOH
	- CH$_3$COOH $\rightleftharpoons$ CH$_3$COO$^-$ + H$_3$O$^+$

### Salts
- Salt is a substance that forms when hydrogen in an acid is substituted by metal ion
	- e.g. $HCl$ (acid) → $NaCl$ (salt)
		- Hydrogen is substituted by sodium
	- General equation: $H$*A* + *M*$OH$ → *MA* + $H_2O$
		- *A* → Anion, *M* → Metal Ion
- When Arrhenius acids and bases interact, they undergo a **neutralisation** reaction
	- This produces water and a salt
	- Acid + Base → Salt + $H_2O$

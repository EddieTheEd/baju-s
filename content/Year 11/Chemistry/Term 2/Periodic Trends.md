- My OneNote page for periodic trends is very informative and has a lot of content

### Atomic Radius
- Atomic radius is the radius of an atom
	- The distance from the nucleus to the outermost electron shell
- Atomic radius ==increases down the group== but ==decreases across the period==

- Caesium has the biggest atomic radius
- Helium has the smallest atomic radius

### Ionisation Energy
- Ionisation energy is the amount of energy needed to remove an electron from an atom
- The smaller an atom is, the harder it is to remove an electron from it
	- Shielding from electrons between the outermost electrons and the nucleus reduce the attractive force of the nucleus
	  ![](Excalidraw/Shielding|400|)
- Ionisation energy is inversely proportional to atomic radius

### Electronegativity
- Electronegativity is how much an atom pulls electrons towards itself
	- In a covalent bond between two different elements, the electron density is not shared equally
- $\delta$ is the symbol used to represent electronegativity
	- e.g. H$^{\delta+}$ : O$^{\delta-}$ : H$^{\delta+}$ for a water molecule
		- Oxygen is far more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms
- Electronegativity is inversely proportional to atomic radius

	- However, noble gases do not have electronegativity since they do not want to receive extra electrons due to already being stable
		- Therefore fluorine is the most electronegative atom

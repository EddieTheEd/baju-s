The central idea of belonging is constructed to evoke empathy from the audience in <u>Crazy Rich Asians</u> (2019), a romantic-comedy film directed by Jon M. Chu that follows a Chinese-American professor who travels to meet her boyfriend's family and they turn out to be one of the wealthiest families in Singapore. Jon uses symbolism, audio and visual features to highlight the struggle to belong faced by the main-protagonist, Rachel Chu, due to differences in culture and class.

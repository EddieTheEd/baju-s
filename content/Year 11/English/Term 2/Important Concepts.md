### Representations
- Representation means to re-present something
	- Present again, usually through the filter (bias) of the author
- Representations of people, events, issues or subjects are constructed through the use of conventions, techniques and language or stylistic features
- By identifying how a text chooses to represent something, we are able to recognise that these representations are not necessarily truthful or accurate
	- Good analysis is not afraid of questioning or critiquing representations
- Analysing Representations - ==WHIP==
	- **What** is the representation exactly?
		- e.g. 'Climate change is occuring due to the actions of humans'
	- **How** is this representation constructed?
		- e.g. 'Climate change is a direct result of human intervention, with industrialisation, over-population and poor enviornmental stewardship directly impacting on the extent and pace of climate change'
	- What are the **contextual influences** of the represenation?
		- e.g. Many people, especially big oil and gas corporations and politicians, do not recognise climate change as an issue and think that it is a natural process. Thus they do not take measures to prevent it and do not restrict their actions that contribute to the issue leading to increased damage.
	- What **purposes** does this representation serve?
		- e.g. This representation of climate change aims to cause audiences to recognise the role humanity has in climate change and that we need to restrict our impact on climate, especially those who play big roles in pollution and other factors that influence climate change, otherwise it will lead to the destruction of the environment.

### Perspectives

		- A text may offer multiple perspectives
- Perspective is the lens we view the world represented by the text with

- Analysing Perspective
	- Whose perspective is provided or emphasised in the text?
	- Does this perspective work to represent a larger group in society or a shared ideology?

### Context
- [Australia: 8 Years of Abusive Offshore Asylum Processing](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/07/15/australia-8-years-abusive-offshore-asylum-processing#:~:text=Individuals%20and%20families%20with%20children,inhumane%20treatment%2C%20and%20medical%20neglect.)
- Where do refugees come from?
	- Many countries across Asia are not safe due to poverty, war, politcal and economic instability, natural disasters and more
		- e.g. Myanmar after the milatary coup in 2021 and the Rohingya people who have faced mass violence, persecution and genocide
- Refugees in Thailand
	- Thailand is where many of these refugees go
	- However there is little protection for refugees in Thailand
	- Refugees are unable to legally work
		- They lack access to basic resouces like food, water and education
	- Thailand's Immigration Act 1979 catagorises all refugees as illegal immigrants
		- Refugees are vunerable to arbitrary arrest, detention and deportation.
		- Many rangers hunt down large groups of refugees who are then arrested and could be sent back to their home country
			- This leads to refugees live in fear of prosecution constantly
- Australia's Management of Incoming Refugees
	- Since 2013, the Australian government has forcibly transferred more than 3000 refugees to processing camps
	- Refugees spend years in sub-standard conditions in these camps
		- They suffer from severe abuse, inhumane treatment and medical neglect
	- Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that **“Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy asylum in other countries without persecution.”**
		- This is not upheld in Australia at all with most refugees being trapped forever in these camps or being sent back to countries like Thailand
	- Shaun Hanns, a former official in Australia’s immigration department, has said the whole process is a “waste of taxpayer money to torment people, to not impact on the ultimate outcome in any meaningful way anyway"

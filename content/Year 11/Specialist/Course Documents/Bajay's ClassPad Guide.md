- ### General Functions:
	- solve(equation, variable) 
		- keyboard → math 1 → solve
		- Will solve for the variable from the equation 
		- Adding (solve() **| x = y**) means x will be replaced with y
			- i.e: solve given that x = y
- ### Vector Functions
	- Finding unit vector → e.g: ${\hat{a}}$ if $a =$ $[{{x}\atop{y}}]$
		- unitV($[{{x}\atop{y}}]$)
			- action → vector → unitV
	- Finding magnitude of $a + b$ → e.g: |$[{{i}\atop{j}}]$ + $[{{x}\atop{y}}]$| 
		- norm($[{{i\  + \ x}\atop{j\  + \ y}}]$)
			- action → vector → norm
	- Finding angle between two vectors
		- angle($[{{i}\atop{j}}]$, $[{{x}\atop{y}}]$) 
			- separate vectors with a comma
			- action → vector → angle
	- Solving dot product
		- dotP($[{{i}\atop{j}}]$, $[{{x}\atop{y}}]$)
			- action → vector → dotP
- ### Other Important Stuff
	- The factorial (!) button is found under advanced tab in the second page of the keyboard
	- If you need to write something as ${+ \atop -}{\sqrt{x}}$, write out the equation twice
		- One for positive surd x and one for negative surd x

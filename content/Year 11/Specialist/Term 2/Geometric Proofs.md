### Circle Proofs
- #### Arcs/Segment Proofs
	- The angle at the centre of a circle is twice the angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc
		![](Excalidraw/CircleProofArc1|400|)
	- Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal
		![](Excalidraw/CircleProofArc2|400|)
	- Angles in a semicircle are always $90^\circ$
		- $\overline{AB}$ is the diameter
		![](Excalidraw/CircleProofAnglesInSemicircle|400|)
- #### Tangent Proofs
	- A line tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn from the point of contact
		![](Excalidraw/CircleProofTangent1|400|)
	- The two tangents drawn from an external point are the same length
		- i.e $PT = PT'$  
		![](Excalidraw/CircleProofTangent2|400|)
	- The angle between a tangent and a chord drawn from the point of contact is equal to any angle in the **alternate segment**
		  ![](Excalidraw/CircleProofTangent3|400|)
		- Points $A$ and $B$ are stationary, but the point where they meet on the alternate segment can move and $\theta$ will always equal the angle between the tangent and the chord $\overline{AB}$
		
- #### Chord/Secant Proofs
	- If $AB$ and $CD$ are two chords of a circle that cut at a point $P$, then:
		- $PA \cdot PB = PC \cdot PD$
		![](Excalidraw/CircleProofChord1|400|)
		- This also works if $P$ is outside the circle
		![](Excalidraw/CircleProofChord2|400|)
	- If $P$ is a point outside a circle and $T$, $A$, $B$ are points on the circle such that $PT$ is a tangent and $PAB$ is a secant, then $|PT|^2 = |PA| \cdot |PB|$
	  ![](Excalidraw/CircleProofChord3|400|)
- #### Cyclic Quadrilateral Proofs
	- A quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if the sum of each pair of **opposite angles** is 180$\degree$
		- $a + c = 180^{\circ},\ \  b + d = 180^{\circ}$

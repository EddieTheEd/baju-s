### Important Terms
- #### Sets of Numbers
	- $\mathbb{N}$ - Natural Numbers
		- Positive, whole numbers
	- $\mathbb{Z}$ - Integers
		- Positive or negative whole numbers
	- $\mathbb{Q}$ - Rational Numbers
		- Numbers that can be represented as a fraction
	- $\mathbb{R}$ - All Real Numbers
		- Numbers that are real
- #### Definitions
	- $\subseteq$ - Subset
	- **Theorem** - A statement that has been proved
	- **Conjecture** - A statement which is suspected to be true
- #### Quantifiers
	- **For all** - $\forall$
		- e.g. 'For all odd integers $n$,  $n^2$ + $1$ is even.'
		- We must prove that if $n$ is **any** an odd integer, then $n^2 + 1$ is even 
		- We must satisfy all cases to prove the statement
			- To prove → give a general argument that shows the statement is always true
			- To disprove → give example that disproves statement
	- **There exists** - $\exists$
		- e.g. 'There exists a prime number which is not odd.'
		- Proof: 2 is even and prime
		- We only need to satisfy one case to prove the statement
			- To prove → give example that satisfies condition
			- To disprove → give a general argument that shows the statement can't be true

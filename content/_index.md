Hello! I'm Ajay (or Bajay, or Ajay Bajay, or whatever you want to call me), this is my website of notes from Obsidian which I was bullied into using by Jonathan Lee. Thank you Jonathan. If something seems off in this website, it was probably Jonathan who wrote it. Thank you to Jonathan and Edward for being a massive help in setting this up!

I am a member of the town. I will link my friend's sites here soon!

Originally my notes were on OneNote (suffering) and a lot of them are still on there. Unfortunately unless you are on the Notes OneNote for 2023, you won't be able to access them. However I'm sure you can find use for all my notes on Obsidian! Don't be afraid to ask for my help for anything (except English), I'm a good listener and an ex-student councillor.
